# Marketing Studio 4.5.0

Marketing Studio 4.5.0 ships Blog Studio 4.7.0, Presentation Studio 4.5.0 and Training Studio 4.5.0, with Harness Research 1.0.1 pinned and Tanzu Brand 0.14.1 tested. These are the changes since 4.0.0.

- **Your team's repository, connected.** Home says where each studio's work lives: connected to a repository and branch, local Git on this computer, or not connected, with a **Connect** action. A shared repository set in Marketing Studio now reaches studios that already have a workspace.
- **One team library.** Blog Studio keeps finished blogs, added files, lists of links and Google Docs in one library, each with a role, an author and a kind of post. A list of links by many authors is sorted by each post's own byline.
- **Voices and styles.** Learn a voice for any author, so ghostwriting has one voice for each person, and start from eight ready-made styles for technical writing. A voice can be learned from a file of links to an author's posts, from up to twenty samples. Voices and styles opens from Blog Studio's Home and sidebar.
- **Say what each file is for.** Each upload is marked as facts, an example of the kind of post, or approved messaging. Examples shape a post but never supply its facts. **I know the point** starts from the point you already have, and you choose the voice as you go. Write from a brief takes every file at once, and a Google Doc is read tab by tab.
- **The authoring workflow review, Phases 1 to 5.** Research can finish, and a failure says what to do next. Each thing has one name, and **Where this run stops** sets how often a run stops for you, saved once for every studio. Research stops show the brief, the independent check, the gaps and the findings for each question, along with what a change would cost. A training, deck or blog can be finished on its page: download it, bring back your edits, apply review findings and approve the version shown. Harness Slides, Harness Research and the brand skill are now fully used.
- **Research checks read the originals.** The independent check reads a supplied Google Doc, PDF or Word file as it is, so supplied material no longer fails the check again and again.
- **Research from your documents, your sites and/or the public web**, in every studio. Your sites are listed in Shared settings. Each page research saves is checked against them, redirects included, and a site can be added for a single piece of work.
- **Announcements that read like announcements.** Blog Studio writes approved messaging in the product's own voice and keeps source notes and open questions out of the text.
- **Delete from the lists.** Decks, trainings and blogs can be deleted from the lists and Home cards that show them, with each studio's usual confirmation.
- **Also since 4.0.0:** one shared Golden Gate look on every studio page; `marketing-studio start`, `stop` and `restart`; installer diagnostics and repository sync; slide text you can change after a deck is built; blogs finished, published, deleted and restored from the page; a blog written from your uploaded files, with three angles to pick from; and pages that work better on a phone.
- **Companions.** Installs use Harness Research 1.0.1 and Harness Slides 0.16.0, each at an exact commit and source checksum. Decks need a brand skill at 0.14.0 or newer, and this release was tested with Tanzu Brand 0.14.1. Marketing Studio never installs the brand skill.

Download `marketing-studio-installer.zip` for the whole suite, or one studio's installer ZIP. Each has a `.sha256` file for checking the download. Unzip it, then run `bash install.sh` in the unpacked folder, or open `installer/Install Marketing Studio.command` on macOS. Close running studios before you update. Your existing workspaces and settings are kept.

Signing in to an assistant, your organisation's brands and fonts, and optional Google setup are still your choices. Installing starts no provider job.

## Unreleased: Infographic Studio 0.1.0

Adds the fourth independent editing desk for supplied text, Markdown and selected
CSV: source-backed story choices, six one-page forms, explicit brand snapshots,
Codex/Gemini image adapters, precise art direction and reference edits, actual-pixel
review, focused copy/story edits, immutable history/restore, exact user approval and
PNG/PDF/editable SVG/accessible-text delivery. Marketing Studio adds shared setup,
native discovery, lifecycle/CLI flags and protected phone/LAN launch.

The pipeline uses Python's standard library and no frontend build or image SDK.
Infographic Studio-only packages omit Research/Slides companions; unrelated subsets
omit its renderer. Its initial acceptance target is macOS ARM64. Live generation,
reference editing and inspection for both provider routes, owner illustration
acceptance and publication remain separate gates. See the
[release acceptance checklist](../studios/infographic/docs/acceptance.md).
